_finalsize_ provides calculations for the final size of an epidemic in a population, which is the overall number of infected individuals, depending on a demographic distribution (e.g., age groups) and their contact patterns, accounting for different susceptibility to disease between groups (e.g., due to age-group specific immune responses) and within groups (e.g., due to immunisation programs).

_finalsize_ implements methods outlined in @andreasen2011, @miller2012, @kucharski2014, and @bidari2016.

_finalsize_ can help provide rough estimates of the effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions in the form of immunisation programmes, or the effect of naturally acquired immunity through previous infection (see the vignette).

_finalsize_ relies on [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) via [RcppEigen](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppEigen) for fast matrix algebra, and is developed at the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as part of the [Epiverse Initiative](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/).

## Installation

The package can be installed using

```r
install.packages("finalsize")
```

The current development version of _finalsize_ can be installed from [Github](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/finalsize) using the `remotes` package.

```r
# check whether {remotes} is installed
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("epiverse-trace/finalsize")
```

## Quick start

_finalsize_ provides the single function `final_size()`, to calculate the final size of an epidemic.

Here, an example using social contact data from the _socialmixr_ package investigates the final size of an epidemic when the disease has an R<sub>0</sub> of 1.5, and given three age groups of interest --- 0-19, 20-39 and 40+.
The under-20 age group is assumed to be fully susceptible to the disease, whereas individuals aged over 20 are only half as susceptible as those under 20.

```{r}
# load finalsize
library(finalsize)

# Load example POLYMOD data included with the package
data(polymod_uk)

# Define contact matrix (entry {ij} is contacts in group i reported by group j)
contact_matrix <- polymod_uk$contact_matrix

# Define population in each age group
demography_vector <- polymod_uk$demography_vector

# Define susceptibility of each group
susceptibility <- matrix(
  data = c(1.0, 0.5, 0.5),
  nrow = length(demography_vector),
  ncol = 1
)

# Assume uniform susceptibility within age groups
p_susceptibility <- matrix(
  data = 1.0,
  nrow = length(demography_vector),
  ncol = 1
)

# R0 of the disease
r0 <- 1.5 # assumed for pandemic influenza

# Calculate the proportion of individuals infected
final_size(
  r0 = r0,
  contact_matrix = contact_matrix,
  demography_vector = demography_vector,
  susceptibility = susceptibility,
  p_susceptibility = p_susceptibility
)
```
