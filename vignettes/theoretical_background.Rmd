_finalsize_ provides methods to calculate the final proportion of individuals in different age groups infected during an epidemic, as predicted by an age-stratified SIR model. In this vignette we lay out the mathematical concepts behind the functionality available in the package.

## From SIR to final size with homogeous mixing

The dynamics of the proportion of susceptible and infectious individuals over time in the standard susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic model are given by the following ordinary differential equations:
$$
\frac{d S(t)}{d t} = -\beta S(t) I(t) \\
\frac{d I(t)}{d t}  =  \beta S(t) I(t) -\gamma I(t)
$$
where $\beta$ is the transmission rate and $\gamma$ is the rate of recovery.

To calculate the proportion infected, we need to derive an expression for the proportion of susceptibles who got infected during the epidemic, i.e. $\phi = 1- S(\infty)/S(0)$. Rather than simulating the model over a very long time period (i.e. $t \rightarrow \infty $), we can instead divide the above ODE for $S(t)$ by $S$ and integrate:

$$
\int_0^\infty \frac{d S}{d t} \frac{1}{S} \frac{1}{\gamma} dt = -\frac{\beta}{\gamma} \int_0^\infty I(t) dt
$$
We can get an expression for the integral of $I(t)$ by summing up the ODEs for $S(t)$ and $I(t)$:
$$
- \gamma \int_0^\infty I(t) dt  = \int_0^\infty \frac{d S}{d t} + \frac{d I}{d t} dt
$$
Hence we obtain the following expressions:
$$
\int_0^\infty \frac{d S}{d t} \frac{1}{S} \frac{1}{\gamma} dt =\frac{1}{\gamma} [ \mathrm{log}~S(\infty) -\mathrm{log}~S(0) ] = \frac{1}{\gamma}  \mathrm{log}~\frac{S(\infty)}{S(0)} = -\frac{\beta}{\gamma} \int_0^\infty I(t) dt \\
- \gamma \int_0^\infty I(t) dt  =  \int_0^\infty \frac{d S}{d t} + \frac{d I}{d t} dt = S(\infty) -S(0) 
$$
We can rearrange by substituting the $I(t)$ integral in the first line into the second, and rewriting in terms of the basic reproduction number $R_0 = \gamma/\beta$ (i.e. the average number of secondary infectious generated by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population). This gives:

$$
\frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{S(\infty)}{S(0)} = -\frac{\beta}{\gamma}  \frac{1}{\gamma} [S(\infty) -S(0) ] \\
\mathrm{log}~\frac{S(\infty)}{S(0)}  = -R_0 [S(\infty) -S(0) ]
$$
Under the assumption the population is fully susceptible initially (i.e. $S(0)=1$), we obtain the following:
$$
\mathrm{log}~\phi  -R_0 (1-\phi) = 0 = F(\phi)
$$

This equation doesn't have an analytical solution, but can be solved numerically with Newton’s method:
1. Select an arbitrary initial estimate $\x_0$ and tolerance $T$ ;
2. Solve $\frac{dF}{d \phi} (x_0) \Delta x = −F(x_0) ~ \text{for } ~ \Delta x$ ;
3. Set $x_{i+1} = x_i + \Delta x$;
4. Repeat until $x_i$ converges sufficiently (i.e. difference in each step is less than $T$)

## Final size equation with heterogenous mixing

We can extend the same derivation for the above homogenous model for populations with multiple age groups, following [Andreasen et al](about:blank). The age-dependent ODEs are defined as follows:

$$
\frac{d S(a,t)}{d t} = -S(a,t) \sum_b \beta_{ab} I(b,t) \\
\frac{d I(a,t)}{d t}  =  S(a,t) \sum_b \beta_{ab} I(b,t) -\gamma I(a,t)
$$
Where $\beta_{a,b}$ is the transmission rate from group $b$ to group $a$. If we define $R_{a,b} =\beta_{a,b}/\gamma$ to be group specific reproduction number, we can follow the above logic to derive an expression for the final size in each age group:

$$
- \sum_b R_{a,b}  \int_0^\infty I(s,t)  ~dt  = \int_0^\infty \frac{d S}{d t} \frac{1}{S} ~dt = \mathrm{log}~S(a,\infty) -\mathrm{log}~S(a,0) = \mathrm{log}~\frac{S(a,\infty)}{S(a,0)}  \\
 -\int_0^\infty I(a,t)  ~dt = \int_0^\infty \frac{d S}{d t} +\frac{dI}{dt} ~dt = S(a,\infty) -S(a,0)  ~.
$$
and hence:

$$
\mathrm{log}~\frac{S(a,\infty)}{S(a,0)}  = - \sum_b R_{a,b} [ S(a,\infty) -S(a,0)]
$$

If we define $\phi = (\phi_1, ... \phi_n)$ to be a vector of final sizes in each of $n$ age group, we can rewrite the above as

$$
\mathrm{log}~\phi  -\mathbf{R} (1-\phi) = 0 = F(\phi)
$$
where $\mathbf{R}$ is a matrix with entries $R_{i,j}$. Once again, we can use Newton's method, this time with $\phi$ as a vector, and hence we need to a set of linear equations in step 2.
