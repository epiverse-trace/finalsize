  abstract = {Final epidemic size relations play a central role in mathematical epidemiology. These can be written in the form of an implicit equation which is not analytically solvable in most of the cases. While final size relations were derived for several complex models, including multiple infective stages and models in which the durations of stages are arbitrarily distributed, the solvability of those implicit equations have been less studied. In this paper the SIR homogeneous mean-field and pairwise models and the heterogeneous mean-field model are studied. It is proved that the implicit equation for the final epidemic size has a unique solution, and that through writing the implicit equation as a fixed point equation in a suitable form, the iteration of the fixed point equation converges to the unique solution. The Markovian SIR epidemic model on finite networks is also studied by using the generation-based approach. Explicit analytic formulas are derived for the final size distribution for line and star graphs of arbitrary size. Iterative formulas for the final size distribution enable us to study the accuracy of mean-field approximations for the complete graph.},

  abstract = {Final size relations are known for many epidemic models. The derivations are often tedious and difficult, involving indirect methods to solve a system of integro-differential equations. Often when the details of the disease or population change, the final size relation does not. An alternate approach to deriving final sizes has been suggested. This approach directly considers the underlying stochastic process of the epidemic rather than the approximating deterministic equations and gives insight into why the relations hold. It has not been widely used. We suspect that this is because it appears to be less rigorous. In this note we investigate this approach more fully and show that under very weak assumptions (which are satisfied in all conditions we are aware of for which final size relations exist) it can be made rigorous. In particular the assumptions must hold whenever integro-differential equations exist, but they may also hold in cases without such equations. Thus the use of integro-differential equations to find a final size relation is unnecessary and a simpler, more general method can be applied.},
