  abstract = {We study the final size equation for an epidemic in a subdivided population with general mixing patterns among subgroups. The equation is determined by a matrix with the same spectrum as the next generation matrix and it exhibits a threshold controlled by the common dominant eigenvalue, the basic reproduction number \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\_\{0\}\}\$: There is a unique positive solution giving the size of the epidemic if and only if \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\_\{0\}\}\$exceeds unity. When mixing heterogeneities arise only from variation in contact rates and proportionate mixing, the final size of the epidemic in a heterogeneously mixing population is always smaller than that in a homogeneously mixing population with the same basic reproduction number \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\_\{0\}\}\$. For other mixing patterns, the relation may be reversed.},

  abstract = {Final epidemic size relations play a central role in mathematical epidemiology. These can be written in the form of an implicit equation which is not analytically solvable in most of the cases. While final size relations were derived for several complex models, including multiple infective stages and models in which the durations of stages are arbitrarily distributed, the solvability of those implicit equations have been less studied. In this paper the SIR homogeneous mean-field and pairwise models and the heterogeneous mean-field model are studied. It is proved that the implicit equation for the final epidemic size has a unique solution, and that through writing the implicit equation as a fixed point equation in a suitable form, the iteration of the fixed point equation converges to the unique solution. The Markovian SIR epidemic model on finite networks is also studied by using the generation-based approach. Explicit analytic formulas are derived for the final size distribution for line and star graphs of arbitrary size. Iterative formulas for the final size distribution enable us to study the accuracy of mean-field approximations for the complete graph.},

  abstract = {Variability in the risk of transmission for respiratory pathogens can result from several factors, including the intrinsic properties of the pathogen, the immune state of the host and the host's behaviour. It has been proposed that self-reported social mixing patterns can explain the behavioural component of this variability, with simulated intervention studies based on these data used routinely to inform public health policy. However, in the absence of robust studies with biological endpoints for individuals, it is unclear how age and social behaviour contribute to infection risk. To examine how the structure and nature of social contacts influenced infection risk over the course of a single epidemic, we designed a flexible disease modelling framework: the population was divided into a series of increasingly detailed age and social contact classes, with the transmissibility of each age-contact class determined by the average contacts of that class. Fitting the models to serologically confirmed infection data from the 2009 Hong Kong influenza A/H1N1p pandemic, we found that an individual's risk of infection was influenced strongly by the average reported social mixing behaviour of their age group, rather than by their personal reported contacts. We also identified the resolution of social mixing that shaped transmission: epidemic dynamics were driven by intense contacts between children, a post-childhood drop in risky contacts and a subsequent rise in contacts for individuals aged 35-50. Our results demonstrate that self-reported social contact surveys can account for age-associated heterogeneity in the transmission of a respiratory pathogen in humans, and show robustly how these individual-level behaviours manifest themselves through assortative age groups. Our results suggest it is possible to profile the social structure of different populations and to use these aggregated data to predict their inherent transmission potential.},

  abstract = {Final size relations are known for many epidemic models. The derivations are often tedious and difficult, involving indirect methods to solve a system of integro-differential equations. Often when the details of the disease or population change, the final size relation does not. An alternate approach to deriving final sizes has been suggested. This approach directly considers the underlying stochastic process of the epidemic rather than the approximating deterministic equations and gives insight into why the relations hold. It has not been widely used. We suspect that this is because it appears to be less rigorous. In this note we investigate this approach more fully and show that under very weak assumptions (which are satisfied in all conditions we are aware of for which final size relations exist) it can be made rigorous. In particular the assumptions must hold whenever integro-differential equations exist, but they may also hold in cases without such equations. Thus the use of integro-differential equations to find a final size relation is unnecessary and a simpler, more general method can be applied.},
